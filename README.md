Project-192
===========

Project 192, a joint GGP-DSA2 project.

## To Build and Run
Run the init PowerShell script, the Game/init.bat script until there are no errors, and then run Game/build.bat. Inside Visual Studio, make sure that Graphos.Core is the startup project, and that it's working directory is `$(OutDir)`. From there, you should be good to run the solution.
